**Name:** My Portfolio.

**Description:**  My background is in Business Admistration. Most of my career I worked with financial and data analysis for large companies. Most recently, I've been interested in creating applications for the web. I decided to enroll in the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN - February 2021

This is a work in progress of my portfolio page, where I hope to showcase my projects and technical skills.
